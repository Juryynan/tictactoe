# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description
This is small and simple game developed with C. Project was 
inspired by memories from first programming classes, so i thought
it would be cool to write something nostalgic and idea game that 
tic-tac-toe would be fun.

First you name players, then just play and win! 
You can also view player highscores!
